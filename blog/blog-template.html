    <p >
      These are my blogs that I write at the end of each week throughout my DevBootCamp phases. As of right now I blog about the cultural and technical apsects of each week. Each week we cover a variety of topics crucial to web-developement, some of them involving various programming languages that are taught on the spot. I find that the experiences gained through each week have helped me to cover much more material than I ever could have on my own. Here I try my best to encapculate those experiences and adequately explore the material covered in my technical entries. Also, as the course progresses I've gotten to know people better and my overall understanding of the cohort continues to grow as well as my understanding of DBC's culture in general. I'll be writing about my expanding DBC social experiences in my cultural entries.

        Periodically I'll be updating this site as I learn new things, and discover how to add cool new features. As for now, I hope you're impressed with different background colors and beveled borders!
    </p>

        Aditionally, I'll be adding more content here once as I start to produce finished coding assignments for DBC as well as projects I persue out of my own interest.
