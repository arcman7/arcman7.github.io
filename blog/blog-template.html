  <h2>Andrew's Blogs</h2>
  <h4>Updated:</h4>
  <h4>March 7, 2015</h4>

  <!--<section> -->
    <p >
      Here are my blogs that I write at the end of each week throughout my DevBootCamp phases. I currently blog about the cultural and technical aspects of each week. We cover a variety of topics crucial to web-development, some of them involving various programming languages that are taught on the spot. I find that the experience gained through each week have helped me to cover much more material than I ever could have on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, I try my best to encapsulate those experiences and adequately explore the material covered in my technical entries. I've gotten to know people better as the course progresses - both my overall understanding of the cohort continues to grow as well as my understanding of DBC's culture. I'll be writing about my expanding DBC social experiences in my cultural entries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Periodically I'll be updating this site as I learn new things, and discover how to add cool new features. I hope you're impressed with different background colors and beveled borders! I'll also be adding more content here once as I start to produce finished coding assignments for DBC as well as projects I pursue on my own.
