  <!-- What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?-->
  <p> In this post I would like to talk about the usage of classes and id's in the context of CSS. Html is a nice language to write in, it's very intuitive, and theres not a lot of vocabularly learn. However, as anyone who's ever tried will know, it gets rather tedious coding up the format to each and every object over and over again! Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to do this? Well there is! This is where CSS comes in handy, and is an absolute must for anyone developing even a single web-page.CSS allows you to build a style sheet (uses the .css file extension), where you can specify a certain class or id of objects and your html will be formatted accordingly. Classes take the form of:
  .class_name{ property:value;}. Id's look like this: #id_name{property:value;}. The distinction between using id's or classes really comes down to a matter of neatness in your css style sheet. Classes should be used to specify attributes to objects that you expect to be using in numerous places and also across different object types. Id's on the other hand should only be used for specifying the properties or attributes of a specific that gets used once. In this way, you have methods or oddities or exceptions that come up in building your webpage and you want to have a way to isolate them from common classes that get used for just about everything.
