    <p> My name is Andrew Ryan Carpenter, I was born and raised on the island of Oahu and spent most of my life in Kaneohe Bay. Though my schooling background focused primarily on physics and math, I've used C++ on ocassion for mostly scientific purposes and I am taking a course on modern web-development through DevBootCamp. I studied at the University of Hawaii and graduated with a Bachelors of Physics, where I then continued to do research under Professor John Learned, in the mini Time Cube experiment. Growing up in Hawaii I really enjoyed sailing, kayacking, snorkeling, camping surfing, particularly bodyboarding, but now that I've moved to the states I've taken up snowboarding and shooting pool.

    <p>My course through DevBootCamp has taught me a lot of front-end skills so far, but I've also very interesting in learning back-end systems. I found that a lot the work I did in the mini Time Cube project had applicable skills to designing back-end data structures. The work I did mostly concerened analyzing large data sets that pertained to the light emissions from muon particles in a monolithic scintilating cube. The need arose to oraganize the data in such a way that could characterize different physical events happening inside the cube such as different forms of radiation. </p>
