    <p> My name is Andrew Ryan Carpenter. I was born and raised on the island of Oahu and grew up in Kaneohe Bay. Growing up in Hawaii, I really enjoyed sailing, kayaking, snorkeling, camping, and surfing - particularly body-boarding. Now that I have relocated to California, however, I've taken up snowboarding and shooting pool.

    <p>I studied at the University of Hawaii where I assisted in the mini Time Cube experiment under Professor John Learned, and graduated with a Bachelors of Physics. Although my educational background focused primarily on physics and math, I have occasionally coded in C++ for scientific purposes.  Currently, I am taking a course on modern web-development through DevBootCamp. </p>

    <p>My course through DevBootCamp has taught me a lot of front-end skills so far, but I am also very interested in learning back-end systems. The work I previously did on the mini Time Cube project mostly concerned analyzing large data sets pertaining to the light emissions from muon particles in a monolithic scintillating cube. The data needed to be organized to be able to characterize different physical events happening inside the cube. I found that my experience in the mini Time Cube project, particularly in data set organization, gave me applicable skills to designing back-end data structures.</p>
