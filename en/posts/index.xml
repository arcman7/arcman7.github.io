        <description>In this post we will implement the K-Means Clustering algorithm in python. You will not need to know any python libraries such as numpy or pandas as this will be done in vanilla python. The key take aways here are:
 The algorithm by itself is naive, and not guaranteed to converge on the best fit centroid locations We need an optimizer of sorts to find an acceptable centroid fit  The goal of the K-means clustering algorithm is to fit a given set of data points into K specified groups or clusters.</description>

        <description>So I built a game engine in javascript using Vue.js to do the rendering. It&amp;rsquo;s in an in-progress project, and therefore this post is as well.

        <title>Javascript: Sequential Task Queue</title>

        <description>I decided to write this post as the result of attempting to find a pattern for executing any number of asynchronous tasks in a specified order with javascript. It came as a surprise to me that this isn&amp;rsquo;t supported out of the box in any modern browers javascript engine.
After googling around for a few minutes I came across this related blog post Decembersoft Inc. which comes close but doesn&amp;rsquo;t yield a working solution.</description>
