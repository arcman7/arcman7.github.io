        <description>Introduction In this post I will outline how to run tasks/jobs that have dependencies on other tasks such as builds or testing. When one task is dependent on another it means that the task cannot be be started or executed until it has the results from a previous task/job.
Imagine you plan on making an omelette, this task requires that you have eggs among other things. We can say then that this task, &amp;ldquo;make-omelette&amp;rdquo;, has a dependency on eggs.</description>
